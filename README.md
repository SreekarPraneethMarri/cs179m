Dear Professor Keogh,
We are the Port Organizer team

We are happy to hand in our finished project. 
Please find attached
A single PDF file, TeamPortOrganizer_elicitation.pdf, which contains evidence of our efforts to plan our elicitation of requirements from Mr. Keogh.
A single PDF file, TeamPortOrganizer_Pitch_BEFORE.pdf, which contains our original pitch to Mr. Keogh. 
A single PDF file, TeamPortOrganizer_Pitch_AFTER.pdf, which contains our modified pitch to Mr. Keogh. This document is 90% identical to TeamPortOrganizer_pitch_BEFORE.pdf, but contains corrections, amendments and deletions that came to our attention during the pitch.
A single PDF file, TeamPortOrganizer_design.pdf, which shows evidence of our efforts to design our software. 
A single PDF file, TeamPortOrganizer_Testing.pdf, which shows evidence of our efforts to test our software.
This URL, ABC.html, points to a GitHub repository of our code. 7) This youtube video shows our software solving one balance, and one transfer test case (our choices, of the test cases you gave us).
This youtube video shows our software solving one balance, and one transfer test case (our choices, of the test cases you gave us). 
We would like to point out the following limitations.
Could be possible large datasets do not work for balance. Computation time is too long to find out.
Heuristic is not very tight, therefore will go through more possibilities and in turn increasing time to compute. This means this is not the most optimal solution found. The code takes time in adding data to log files and even visualizing with GUI. Without GUI, the solution obtained is a bit faster (By few seconds).
Balance does not account for dupes besides direct children. So if a different branch is able to reach a state that was previously reached
There is no SIFT case for balance
Our GUI is not fully integrated with our balance and loading/unloading operations
There is no visited layout check in balance.



(some concluding remarks if any) 
Sincerely, team Port Organizer
